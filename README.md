# Active_Learning_on_Image_Classification

## Introduction

Pool-based sampling active learning is implemented in this project. In the task, the data is part of the OmniGlot dataset2 which comprises the alphabets of 30 different languages, with a total of 19,280 images of hand-drawn characters.  
However, we are exploring active learning but not computer vision, so the images are embedded to 1000 dimension vectors. Meanwhile, the labels are embedded into 30 integers (0, 1, ..., 29).  

## Experiment Procedure

### 1. Logistic Regression.
